A boilerplate for creating static CMS websites using Netlify. Basically [this](https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)
but with all the styles stripped out and replaced with Styled System. My version has a couple other goodies, like redux,
which is a bit of a pain to set up in Gatsby.
